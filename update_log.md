# update log
Version 2.1
* I've completely redesigned the code so that it's much simpler to read
* in an effort to learn the tools used in Data Analytics, I've tried to incorporate plotly and pandas into this project
 * here are the notable changes:
  * instead of using lists to plot it onto a graph, I've created a DataFrame, and then used the columns to project it onto a graph
  * used plotly instead of matplotlib
 * I have found this change to be much more appreciated because I find using pandas and plotly delightful
 * output

Version 2.0
* in an effort to become more familiar with Python, I've decided to redo this project in this programming language.
  * here are some notable changes to this project:
    * visualized the data onto a bar graph
    * color codes the bars:
      * farthest distance is red
      * shortest distance is green
      * the rest are blue
    * displays each passenger's fare in the center of each bar
* to broaden my knowledge, I will be continuing this project in Python
* output:
