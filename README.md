I wrote this program because we now unfortunately live in a time where we have to ask our friends for gas money after hanging out with them.

This program calculates how much each passenger should pay their best friend, the driver, based on the following factors:
* the car's MPG
* the current average gas price (dollars per gallon)
* the distance to each passenger's home

Version 1.0
* initial commit
