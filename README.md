I wrote this program because we now unfortunately live in a time where we have to ask our friends for gas money after hanging out with them.

This program calculates how much each passenger should pay their best friend, the driver.

The program takes these inputs from:
* the driver:
  * car's MPG
  * current price per gallon
* the passenger:
  * name
  * distance to drop-off
  
It then appends to a data frame. Provided below is the example of the output:

| name    | distance | city          | cost |
|---------|----------|---------------|------|
| Martin  | 30       | Santa Clarita | 8    |
| James   | 20       | Los Angeles   | 7    |
| Robert  | 25       | Koreatown     | 9    |
| David   | 30       | Monterey Park | 5    |
| John    | 20       | Los Angeles   | 7    |
| Richard | 10       | Glendale      | 8    |
| Michael | 15       | Northridge    | 4    |
| Joseph  | 20       | Los Angeles   | 7    |
| Daniel  | 10       | Glendale      | 5    |

Finally, it graphs this data onto a bar chart:
