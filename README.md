I wrote this program because we now unfortunately live in a time where we have to ask our friends for gas money after hanging out with them.

This program calculates how much each passenger should pay their best friend, the driver, based on the following factors:
* the car's MPG
* the current average gas price (dollars per gallon)

I utilized objects to write this program. 
- Passenger.java is the object file.
- GasMoneyCalc.java is the main file.
Each passenger has their own:
* name
* distance to their home
* how much they owe the driver

First, I calculate the number of miles per dollar based on the car's MPG and the current average gas price.
Then, I multiply this rate by the distane to the passenger's home.
Finally, the program tells me how much each passenger has to pay based on how far it'll take to get to their home.
