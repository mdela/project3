# project3
I wrote this program because we now unfortunately live in a time where we have to ask our friends for gas money after hanging out with them.

This program calculates how much each passenger should pay their best friend, the driver.

The program takes these inputs from:
* the driver:
  * car's MPG
  * current price per gallon
* the passenger:
  * name
  * distance to drop-off
  * fare
  
It calculates the fare based on the car's MPG, each passenger's distance to home, and the current price per gallon.

Once it's made the calculations, it graphs the data onto a bar graph.

# update log
Version 2.0
* in an effort to become more familiar with Python, I've decided to redo this project in this programming language.
  * here are some notable changes to this project:
    * visualized the data onto a bar graph
    * color codes the bars:
      * farthest distance is red
      * shortest distance is green
      * the rest are blue
    * displays each passenger's fare in the center of each bar
* to broaden my knowledge, I will be continuing this project in Python
      
Version 1.0
* initial commit
* this project was initially written in Java:
  * I've utilized arrays and objects as Passengers to achieve this project
  * the files for the Java version can still be found in this repository
